= Change Log

== [1.0.1]

Initial release.

== [1.0.2]

- Output and errors now appear on the console.

- If target doesn't exist, the 'Nothing to do!' message is quashed.

- Added verbs, such as 'clean', that can be given to targets.

- Some termininology refinements: product is now used for the files that a target generates.

== [1.0.3]

- Proper topographical sorting which ensures that dependencies are not called more than one.

- The 'clean' verb can be given to a target via a colon

```
mach jar:clean
```

Currently only one verb can be given to a target at a given time. It's
not yet possible to specify verbs via a depends declaration.

- Refactoring around verbs

- Some AWS-specific functions added to core - these will be moved to a
  separate area once Mach is better structured.

== [1.0.4]

- Multiple verbs can be specified. E.g. `mach foo:bar:zip`

- New verbs added: update and print - see README.md for details

- If the target on the command line doesn't match a target, an attempt
  is made to match on a target's product filename.

== [1.4.2]

- Upgraded to Lumo 1.5

- Output better error message when `mach/dependencies` fails

== [1.4.3]

- npm dependencies specified and installed by `mach/npm` directive.
